# exchange-rate-forecasting
This repository contains Google Colab notebooks for ARIMA and three deep learning and statistical models 
(ARIMA, LSTM, ConvLSTM, and GNN) applied to exchange rate forecasting.  

Each notebook includes both the source code and executed outputs (metrics and plots).  
Currently, the [ConvLSTM notebook](notebooks/ConvLSTM.ipynb) is available with reproducible results, 
as verified by multiple runs. Additional models (LSTM, ConvLSTM, and GNN) will be added progressively.
