FX Policy Shock Impact on Exchange Rate Volatility (Nigeria)
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of Nigeria’s 2023 fuel subsidy removal on foreign exchange (FX) volatility and forecasting performance across major currency pairs:
USD/NGN
EUR/NGN
GBP/NGN
Using daily exchange rate data from January 1, 2020 to June 3, 2025, the study compares model behavior before and after the policy shock to understand how volatility regimes affect predictive accuracy.

Objectives
Examine structural changes in FX volatility following subsidy removal
Build time-series forecasting models under stable and shock conditions
Compare performance across different economic regimes
Evaluate models using RMSE and MAE on denormalized values

🧠 Methods & Tools
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Deep Learning: ConvLSTM, LSTM, STGNN
Baseline Model: ARIMA
Time-series sequence modeling
Policy shock segmentation (pre- vs post-subsidy)
Performance evaluation (RMSE, MAE)
